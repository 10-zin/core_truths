# core_truths
A slow, personalized collection of core truths of life I discover along the way.

1. Desire is suffering
2. Belief is the most foundational basis for all our deductions.
3. The only test of intelligence/success is if you can get what you want from life.
4. The limits of my language mean the limits of my world
